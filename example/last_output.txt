1.2. Existing Systems and Literature

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems have been widely used for text recognition tasks, and OCR engines like Tesseract, CuneiForm, and ABBYY FineReader demonstrate varying performance in multiple languages and scripts (Smith, 2007; Volk et al., 2010). However, IPA symbols present unique challenges. The importance of tailored solutions is emphasized by Gauthier et al. (2016), which developed an OCR engine for the UNIMARC bibliographic format, containing numerous IPA symbols.

1.3. Proposed Methodology and Technical Components

1) Preprocessing
2) Segmentation
3) Feature Extraction
4) Classification
5) IPA-specific Strategies

4. Implementation and Scope

Using Python, we will primarily use TensorFlow and OpenCV for image processing and deep learning tasks. We intend to train our models using a large dataset of IPA images, sourced from IPA databases, online resources, and scanned textbooks. Applicability will be tested across various image types and scenarios, ensuring effectiveness in real-world applications and accommodating different linguistic research and learning use cases.

5. Practicality and Benefits

Successful implementation of the proposed method provides numerous practical benefits:

- Enhancing linguistic analysis by efficiently processing large volumes of IPA data from diverse sources.
- Assisting language learners and educators by simplifying access to IPA information.
- Improving performance of natural language processing and speech synthesis systems by providing reliable IPA input.

7. Budget Breakdown

- Personnel: $100,000 (includes salaries for developers, researchers, and project manager)
- Data Acquisition and Storage: $10,000
- Computational Resources: $20,000 (includes cloud-based GPU resources for training deep learning models)
- Miscellaneous Expenses: $5,000
Total Estimated Budget: $135,000

8. Timetable and Milestones

Month 1-3: Preprocessing and segmentation development
Month 4-6: Feature extraction and classification model development
Month 7-9: IPA-specific strategies implementation and system integration
Month 10-12: Final testing, evaluation, and deployment

9. Conclusion

Upon successful implementation, we aim to achieve:

- High accuracy and efficiency in IPA parsing from images.
- Better understanding and expansion of deep learning techniques for similar linguistic problems.
- A positive impact on research and learning in phonetics, speech sciences, and natural language processing.

By providing stronger links, more detailed literature references, specific budget estimates and timetable, and clear evaluation criteria, this revised proposal demonstrates the project's validity and necessity. We seek funding and approval to advance the project and create a lasting impact in linguistic research and learning.
